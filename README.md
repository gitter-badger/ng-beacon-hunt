# ng-beacon-hunt

Welcome to the ng-beacon hunt game! 

The goal of the game is to find all the ng-beacons in the conference venue, interact with them to get clues and solve puzzles. There are also awesome prizes: A ticket to ng-cruise, ng-beacon and a MiP robot. So what are you waiting for? Let's gets started!

## What are ng-beacons?

Ng-beacons are Bluetooth Low Energy hardware devices which look like the Angular logo we all love. Internally, they run a small embedded JavaScript engine called [Espruino](espruino.com). You can learn more about these beacons and why I created them in [this blog post](https://medium.com/@urish/introducing-ng-beacons-344d79370593#.x6uhqakpg).

## Step 1 - Physical Web

Find the ng-beacon - it is in the food room. The beacon broadcasts a URL which you can receive using the [Physical Web](https://medium.com/@urish/exploring-the-physical-web-without-buying-beacons-efae51e36c2e). If you don't know how to receive these URLs don't worry - just follow the instructions below:
